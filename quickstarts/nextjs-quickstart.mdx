Chipp comes with a specialized NextJS library. Follow the instructions below to integrate.

## 1. Sign up for an account

Sign up for an account on https://app.chipp.ai and create an application to generate your API keys for test and live mode.

## 2. Install Chipp

In your project directory, install Chipp and the Chipp NextJS library by running `npm i chipp @chipp/nextjs-chipp`

## 3. Add API Key

Add your api key as an environment variable in your app with the name `CHIPP_API_KEY`

  <img src="/images/apikey.gif" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

## 4. Create Chipp API folder structure

Add the Chipp API to your project by creating a new folder named `credits` to your `/api` folder in your NextJS project and create a catch-all route named `[...chipp].ts` , e.g. `pages/api/credits/[...chipp].ts`

## 5. Initialize Chipp API

In the `[...chipp].ts` file, add the following:

```typescript
import { handleCredits } from "@chipp/nextjs-chipp";

export default handleCredits({
  getUserIdFromRequest: async (req, res) => {
    // Return a unique identifier for the user making the request.
    // This value is hashed before it is stored in the Chipp system.
  },
});
```

Whenever a request is made to the Chipp API, we need a way to identify which user is making the request so that we can load their credit balance accordingly. You will need to implement the `getUserIdFromRequest` function to return a unique identifier from the request, likely using cookies or authorization headers from the request object.

Here is an example implementation of the `getUserIdFromRequest` function for an application that uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for user authentication:

```typescript
import { getSession } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0";
import { handleCredits } from "@chipp/nextjs-chipp";

export default handleCredits({
  getUserIdFromRequest: async (req, res) => {
    const session = await getSession(req, res);
    if (!session?.user.sub) {
      res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
      return "";
    }

    // This value is hashed before it is stored in the Chipp system.
    return session?.user.sub as string;
  },
});
```

## 6. Add the React Context provider to your client app

Add the `<UserCreditsProvider>` component as a bottom-level provider in your `_app.tsx` file.

```jsx
import { UserCreditsProvider } from "@chipp/nextjs-chipp/client";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    {/* ...Opening tags for your other providers */}
      <UserCreditsProvider>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </UserCreditsProvider>
    {/* ...Closing tags for your other providers */}
  );
}
```

## 7. Display credit amounts using the `useUserCredits` React hook

In the UI portion of your application, use the useUserCredits React hook to display credit balance of the currently logged-in user.

```jsx
import { useUserCredits } from "@chipp/nextjs-chipp/client";

export default function YourComponent() {
  const { userCredits, isLoading: balanceLoading } = useUserCredits();

  if (balanceLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  // userCredits will be defined once balanceLoading is false
  return <div>Credits: {userCredits}</div>;
}
```

<Tip>
  If you specify a default free trial amount of credits for your application,
  each new user will start with that amount of credits.
</Tip>

1. When you make a call to your API to generate something for your user that will require deducting a credit (explained in later steps), call `refreshBalance` after the API call completes to refresh the credit balance of the user.

```jsx
import { useUserCredits } from "@chipp/nextjs-chipp/client";

export default function YourOtherComponent() {
  const { refreshBalance } = useUserCredits();

  const handleButtonClick = async () => {
    // Your API is responsible for deducting credits
    // from the users balance. We'll explain how to
    // do that in later steps.
    const response = await fetch("/api/generate-thing");

    // ...display something from the response to your user

    // Update the user's credit balance.
    // Because we use React Context, calling refreshBalance
    // in one part of your app will update the value everywhere.
    refreshBalance();
  };

  // ...
}
```

<Info>
  Because Chipp uses [React
  Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) in our
  implementation of `useUserCredits` and `UserCreditsProvider`, calling
  `refreshBalance` in one part of your app will update the value everywhere.
</Info>

## 8. Deduct credits from a user's balance

In the API endpoint that is responsible for generating something for your user, call `deductCredits` to deduct credits from the currently logged-in user’s balance. This function will throw an error if the user does not have a sufficient balance, in which case a payment URL will be returned that can be displayed to the user.

```jsx
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import Chipp from "chipp";

const chipp = new Chipp({
  apiKey: process.env.CHIPP_API_KEY as string,
});

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const session = await getSession(req, res);
  const userId = session?.user?.sub;

  const user = await chipp.getUser({ userId: userId as string });
  if (!user) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: "User not found" });
    return;
  }

  // See if the user has enough credits to send a message
  const userChippBalance = await user.getCredits();
  if (userChippBalance < 1) {
    // Get a payment URL for the user to add more credits
    const paymentURL = await user.getPaymentURL({
      // Return the user to the homepage after they've paid
      // BASE_URL is set in .env to be the URL of the homepage
      returnToUrl: process.env.AUTH0_BASE_URL,
    });
    res.status(200).json({
      content: `You don't have enough credits to send a message. Please add more credits at ${paymentURL}`,
    });
    return;
  }

  // ...generate something for your user

  // Deduct 1 credit from the user
  await user.deductCredits(1);

  res.status(200).json({
    content: // the thing you generated for the user,
  });
}
```

<Tip>
  Payment URLs can also be generated on-demand in case you want to allow users
  to “top up” credits at any time.
</Tip>

## Live Example

Here's an example implementation of the @chipp/nextjs-chipp library in the context of a chatbot:

    outline: "1px solid #252525",
    border: 0,
