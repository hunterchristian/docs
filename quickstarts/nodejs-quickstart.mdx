</Warning>

If you are using a JavaScript-based application framework other than NextJS, you can still integrate with Chipp by leveraging the following methods in your Node.js API:

```typescript
import Chipp from "chipp";

const chipp = new Chipp({
  apiKey: "your-api-key-from-Chipp-dashboard",
});

// userId needs to come from your database or auth session
let user = await chipp.getUser({ userId: "a-unique-identifier-for-user" });
// If the user is null, the user does not exist in the Chipp system and needs to be created
if (!user) {
  user = await chipp.createUser({ userId: "a-unique-identifier-for-user" });
}

// Get the number of credits remaining for this user
const numCredits = await user.getCredits();

// Deduct credits from this user
await user.deductCredits(1);

// Generate a payment URL where this user can buy more credits
// Pass in a redirect URL to bring your user back to your app after payment succeeds
const url = await user.getPackagesUrl({
  returnToUrl: "https://your-app.com/wherever-user-was",
});
```
