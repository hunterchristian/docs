The ChippAI Python SDK provides an easy way to integrate with Chipp services from a Python environment. Using this SDK, you can retrieve user details, manage credits, and generate payment URLs for users to buy more credits.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The `chippai` package installed via pip.

## Installation

To install the `chippai` package:

```bash
pip install chippai
```

## Getting Started

To start using the ChippAI Python SDK, you need to import the `Chipp` class and initialize it with your API key.

```python
from chippai import Chipp

chipp = Chipp(api_key="your-api-key-from-Chipp-dashboard")
```

# Working With Users

## Retrieving a User

You can retrieve a user's details by providing a unique user identifier. This identifier should come from your database or authentication session.

```python
user = chipp.get_user(user_id="a-unique-identifier-for-user")
```

## Creating a User

If the returned user object is `None`, it means the user does not exist in the Chipp system. In such cases, you can create a new user by providing the same unique user identifier. You can retrieve a user's details by providing a unique user identifier. This identifier should come from your database or authentication session.

```python
if user is None:
    user = chipp.create_user(user_id="a-unique-identifier-for-user")
```

# Managing Credits

## Checking User's Credits

To check the number of credits remaining for a user:

```python
num_chipps = user.get_credits()
```

## Deducting Credits

You can deduct credits from a user's account:

```python
user.deduct_credits(1)  # Deducts 1 credit from the user's account
```

# Payment Integration

## Generating a Payment URL

To generate a payment URL where a user can choose their preferred package of credits and make a purchase:

```python
url = user.get_packages_url(return_to_url="https://your-app.com/wherever-user-was")
```

After payment, the user will be redirected to the provided `return_to_url`.
